# Boston Travel Guide

This is a Spring MVC web based application that uses Hibernate framework, in which different roles are interacting with each other through JSP pages.

I have used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax and JQuery for client-side development and also implemented spring security, hibernate security, hibernate validator and hibernate filters for improving the performance of the application.

I have also integrated Google API to show different places on map and PayPal API for the payment.
